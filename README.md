## 📌 Overview

**InjuryShield** is an intelligent fitness management platform built to **prevent musculoskeletal injuries** caused by improper workload progression and inadequate recovery monitoring.

Unlike conventional fitness trackers that merely log activity, InjuryShield applies **sports science principles** and adaptive algorithms to proactively detect injury risk and dynamically adjust workout intensity — transforming fitness tracking from passive monitoring to **proactive injury prevention and performance optimization**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept: ACWR Model

The system is built on the scientifically validated **Acute-Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR)** model:

```
Acute Load  →  7-day cumulative training load
Chronic Load  →  28-day rolling average
ACWR Ratio  →  Detects unsafe workload spikes
```

Combined with real-time recovery indicators:

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 😴 Sleep Duration | Hours of sleep logged |
| 😓 Fatigue Level | Subjective energy rating |
| 💪 Muscle Soreness | Soreness rating per muscle group |
| 🧠 Stress Rating | Mental stress self-assessment |
| 📍 Pain Reports | Localized pain mapping |

These inputs generate a **Composite Injury Risk Score (0–100)**:

| Score | Risk Level | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 0 – 33 | 🟢 **Low** | Proceed with planned training |
| 34 – 66 | 🟡 **Moderate** | Reduce intensity, monitor closely |
| 67 – 100 | 🔴 **High** | Deload or rest recommended |
